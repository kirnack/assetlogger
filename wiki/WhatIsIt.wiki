Al was the most responsible lumberjack in the only lumber camp in the
Gersy Mountains. If you needed a tool he would know where that tool
was and who had ever used that tool. One day he decided to leave the

and helped keep track of the laptops. Now he wants to help everyone
keep track of all types of assets.
